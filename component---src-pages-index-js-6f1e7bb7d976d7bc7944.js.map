I promise.</p>\n      <p className=\"aside\">Updated April 2018</p>\n      <p>\n        Thanks for visiting my website. I’m <strong>Will</strong>, as you might\n        have guessed. I’m a software developer in{\" \"}\n        <strong>Fort Worth, TX</strong>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I’ve been doing software development for <strong>9 years</strong>, and\n        as a career for 6 years. I started when I was in high school, working on\n        a start up with another high school student, which eventually got us a\n        write up in the <strong>New York Times</strong>. Sadly, the business did\n        not work out, it turns out that running a business is more difficult\n        than software development. I continued to work on a couple of small\n        development contracts while at college before leaving early to start\n        working full-time developing web applications.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Shortly after leaving college, I joined a remote agency called{\" \"}\n        <strong>UpTrending</strong>. I stayed with them for about 3 years, doing\n        Rails development. They started pivoting to doing more Wordpress sites,\n        and I had been their only on staff Rails developer for the last 9\n        months. I was approached by a local app development agency,{\" \"}\n        <strong>Oven Bits</strong>, and joined with them in the Fall of 2015.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I got to work on some great projects while I was there. I helped build\n        the infrastructure for a <strong>wifi enabled grill/smoker</strong>. I\n        built the backend for an app that let people virtually try different\n        shades of lip stick and share photos of themselves with friends to let\n        them vote on which shade you look best in 💄👄💁‍\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Unfortunately, Oven Bits fell on hard times and had to let go of just\n        about everyone on staff. They’ve since rebounded and are back making\n        wonderful applications. If you’re looking for a larger team that can be\n        a one stop shop for design, mobile app development, and web application\n        development, definitely check them out.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I had to leave Oven Bits a little over a year after I started there. The\n        unplanned unemployment gave me a chance to try being an{\" \"}\n        <strong>independent contractor</strong>. It has always been something I\n        was interested in doing, but was too scared to try when I already had\n        the stability of full-time employment. It’s been a great experience, and\n        I love getting to help <strong>solve problems</strong> for my clients.\n      </p>\n      <p>Here’s a quick list of some of the people I’ve worked with:</p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Cru</strong>, a Christian outreach ministry. I helped their\n        internal team on a project to rebuild an internal tool that they have\n        for their missionaries to keep track of their supporters.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Benchmark Wine Group</strong>, a Napa Valley based wine retailer\n        that sells fine and rare wines to collectors and restaurants around the\n        world. I actually started working with them at UpTrending, building a\n        brand new in-house system to manage their inventory. It also powers the\n        customer facing side of their site, allowing customers to browse and\n        purchase wine. I continue to work with them, adding new features and\n        performing maintenance for their application.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Qeepsake</strong>, a text message baby journal. They text you\n        questions about your kids and compile them for you into a book. I’ve\n        been helping them add new features to their service and helping them\n        build the backend infrastructure for their new mobile apps.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Bethel Media</strong>, the media arm of Bethel Church in\n        Redding, CA. I’ve been helping augment their team for the launch of a\n        new version of Bethel.tv, their streaming service for conferences,\n        sermons, worship sets, classes, and original programming.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When I’m not working, I can be found playing my favorite music for my{\" \"}\n        <strong>7 month old son</strong>, trying to inculcate him into liking my\n        music. I’ve been told this may backfire, but I’m pressing on regardless.\n        My wife and I also like hunting down new restaurants and pretending that\n        we’re “foodies”, even though I maintain the diet of a 7 year old. I love\n        movies and TV shows, and would be happy to talk to you about Breaking\n        Bad, Better Call Saul, Arrested Development, or Seinfeld all day.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I also enjoy playing racquet sports. I’m very competitive when it comes\n        to <strong>racquetball</strong>, ping pong, or Mario Tennis. Also Mario\n        Kart. I welcome any and all challengers.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Thanks for taking the time to read this!
