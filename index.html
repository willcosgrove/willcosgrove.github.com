        Hey there!
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        This is a two minute read, tops.  I promise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for visiting my website.  I’m <strong>Will</strong>, as you might have guessed.  I’m a software developer in <strong>Fort Worth, TX</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first paid programming gig was while I was in high school.  I built a Rails app for another student who lived in California.  That project got us a write-up in the <strong>New York Times</strong>.  And my life has basically been one long walk down the red carpet since.
      </p>
      <p>
        I <strong>dropped out</strong> of college after one year to focus on my education.  Shortly thereafter I started doing Rails development for a remote agency.  I worked there for three years, eventually becoming the de facto <strong>head of their Rails department</strong>.  I moved to a local agency in 2015, where I currently reside.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve had the opportunity to work on some really great projects over the years.  One of the ones I enjoyed the most was helping build the infrastructure for a <strong>wifi enabled grill product</strong>.  It allowed grills to be monitored and controlled from mobile apps.  I enjoy getting to put on new hats and solve different types of problems.
      </p>
      <!--<p>
        What's my biggest flaw?  Probably that I learn too fast
      </p>-->
      <p>
        I also love to learn new things.  Most recently I’ve been very interested in the functional declarative programming charge that’s been introduced to the web development community at large through <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong>.  That has also led me to an interest in doing work with <strong>Elixir</strong> and <strong>Phoenix</strong>, but I have yet to get to work with them in a professional capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, my wife, <strong>Brynn</strong>, and I love hunting down new restaurants around town, watching movies and rarely agreeing on how good they are, and pandering to any one of our three dogs, Bailey, Franklin, and Maeby.  I am also a competitive <strong>racquetball</strong> player.  Not in any official sense, just in that I’m competitive, and I play racquetball.
      </p>
      <!--<p>
        I also exclusively drive Mini’s.  My first car was a blue and white Mini Cooper with bonnet stripes.  And I currently drive a red and black Mini Coupe with racing stripes.  I’m gonna try and make the Mini thing last as long as possible.
      </p>-->

        Thanks for taking the time to read my story.  Next up, I’m going to be working on <span class="caret"></span>
